                    like me. Romney — I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters,
                    but my IQ is one of the highest — and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or
                    insecure, it's not your fault </p>
                  <p style="opacity: 0.75;"><strong style="margin-right: 0.0625em;">*</strong>I am not only the richest
                    president of the richest and most powerful country, but also the richest sportsman!!! I often spend

                          <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented
                            Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features.
                            All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is
                            "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the
                            same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the
                            work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
